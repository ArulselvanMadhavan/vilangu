* Note
== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project.  We urge you to read about the [[https://GiveUpGitHub.org][Give Up
GitHub]] campaign from [[https://sfconservancy.org][Software conservancy]] to understand some of the
reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects. Any use
of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this
project's code in Copilot.

* Vilangu
Vilangu is a compiler for the [[https://www.cs.unh.edu/~cs712/T_language_spec/][T-lang]]. Compiler frontend is written in
OCaml. The backend uses the LLVM infrastructure to generate code for
any desired architecture.
** How to run?
#+begin_src bash
  make vilangu
  # inside docker container
  bash run.sh
#+end_src
** Pending tasks
- [X] translate methods after class_decs are fully inserted into tenv;
  Because the body of the constructor may use fields from classes that
  arenâ€™t fully constructed yet.
- [X] Add default const
- [X] Generate class_name_meth_name_param_type name
- [X] delete statement -> transform to destructor call. Pass this as
  default arg.
  - [X] MethodCall - When field is None, use base as the method name.
  - [X] Translate delete to MethodCall (base = ~refty, fields = None,
    args = None)
  - [X] default destructor should free this?
- [X] Destructor for other classes
  - [X] Object should have a destructor method. It should do nothing.
- [ ] Overload testing
- [-] support for super
  - [X] in destructor
  - [ ] In constructor
- [ ] Test user provided destructor
- [ ] support for null
- [ ] equals method
- [ ] Apply overrides
- [X] Object should have a default constructor.
- [ ] Object should not have a super call in constructor body.
- [ ] Add a default destructor for all classes
- [ ] Throw an error for more than one destructor
- [X] Add a default destructor for arrays
- [X] frontend.proto needs "methodCall"; methodName as string;
  arguments - are expressions. Arg expressions might need bitcast.
- [ ] Warn users of unreachable code blocks after break; continue statements
- [ ] Warn Unused variables
- [ ] nounwind attribute to main, malloc, free, printf
