* Note
== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project.  We urge you to read about the [[https://GiveUpGitHub.org][Give Up
GitHub]] campaign from [[https://sfconservancy.org][Software conservancy]] to understand some of the
reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects. Any use
of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this
project's code in Copilot.

* Vilangu
Vilangu is a compiler for the [[https://www.cs.unh.edu/~cs712/T_language_spec/][T-lang]]. Compiler frontend is written in
OCaml. The backend uses the LLVM infrastructure to generate code for
any desired architecture.
** How to run?
#+begin_src bash
  make vilangu
  # inside docker container
  bash run.sh
#+end_src
** Pending tasks
- [X] translate methods after class_decs are fully inserted into tenv;
  Because the body of the constructor may use fields from classes that
  aren’t fully constructed yet.
- [ ] ArrayCreation - no stack alloc. Use calloc for the object instantiation.
- [ ] Add a default destructor for all classes
- [ ] Add a default destructor for arrays
- [X] Classes - Add names with empty list of fields first. Then, update fields here
- [X] Ref types init to null at variable declaration time. Handle the case when they are used
  without proper initialization.
- [X] Pass line number with all subscript accesses
- [X] Uninit Arrays. Null check
- [X] object.length should not be allowed.
- [X] Handle the case when arrays aren’t declared by used.
- [X] Divide by zero check
- [X] Array type should be int*.
- [X] Respect multiple ranks
- [X] Generate loop blocks to init array based on rank
- [X] Return type of subscript var should be pointer
- [X] Type should also keep track of length and ptr
- [X] Add support for length field
- [ ] Warn users of unreachable code blocks after break; continue statements
- [X] Add support for narrow cast without Object_IsA
- [X] Narrow cast line no
- [X] Subscript exprs should eval to int type of rank 0
- [ ] Warn Unused variables
- [X] Dockerize things
  - [X] Install ocaml libs
  - [X] Install protocol buffer
- [ ] nounwind attribute to main, malloc, free, printf
- [X] phase 3 tests should pass
